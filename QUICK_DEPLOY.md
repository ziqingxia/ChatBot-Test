# Quick Deployment Guide

## Current Status ‚úÖ

The Streamlit app is now configured to handle missing dependencies gracefully. Here's what you need to know:

## Option 1: Full Functionality (Recommended)

Install all dependencies including PDF processing:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Features available:**
- ‚úÖ Complete chat functionality
- ‚úÖ PDF upload and processing
- ‚úÖ Database management
- ‚úÖ All RAG features

## Option 2: Basic Functionality

If you encounter issues with PDF dependencies, the app will still work with basic functionality:

```bash
pip install streamlit openai torch PyYAML pandas numpy
```

**Features available:**
- ‚úÖ Complete chat functionality
- ‚úÖ Database viewing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è PDF processing disabled (shows warning)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual PDF processing required

## How It Works Now

1. **Graceful Fallback**: The app automatically detects if PDF processing modules are available
2. **User Warning**: Shows a warning if PDF processing is not available
3. **Core Functionality**: Chat and database viewing always work
4. **Clear Messages**: Users get clear feedback about what's available

## For Streamlit Cloud

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
2. **Connect to Streamlit Cloud**
3. **Set main file to**: `streamlit_app.py`
4. **Add secret**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`

The app will automatically:
- Use full functionality if all dependencies are available
- Fall back to basic functionality if PDF processing fails
- Show appropriate warnings to users

## Testing

```bash
# Test locally
streamlit run streamlit_app.py

# The app will show you what functionality is available
```

## Troubleshooting

If you see the warning about PDF processing not being available:
1. Install the missing dependencies: `pip install pdf2image pdfminer.six tqdm rich`
2. Or continue with basic functionality (chat will still work perfectly)

The app is now much more robust and user-friendly! üöÄ
