Obviously the AI Bot will also adopt the sameand similar practice, and always stands to be corrected too.\nSpecifically within each talk-group, thee will be additional practices and rules : \n.  Radio check is used as a way of checking in when user first ‘enters’ a new talk group (switchchannel).  This is particularly important in situation; example, where a CSO switch over fromtalk group 3700 to 3701 with mainline intending to communicate with the Traffic Controller,when the train is at the Reception Track. \n.  All radio voice messages\nPractice of RC Comms\nIn the realm of communication dialogues, there are two main personas: the Control persona and the User, with the user often being a trainee.\n### 1. Control Centre Persona\nThe control centre, often led by a coach, guides the communication practice. This can occur in various scenarios, such as seeking entrance for track access. The Operations Control Centre (OCC) must follow specific protocols before granting authorization, including:\n- Providing a TOA (Track Occupancy Authority) number.\n- Stating a time limit (either a period or a specific time).\n- Specifying the method of track access protection (e.g., Standing Train Protection).\n- Reminding the TPO (Train Protection Officer) to update progress.\nThese protocols, along with other rules and terminologies, are captured in the \"Practice Portion\" to ensure consistent communication. The AI bot reinforces these practices by prompting users.\n### Examples of Communication Practice\nThe table illustrates typical interactions between the Player (TPO) and the Chatbot AI (acting as OCC):\n- **Unrecognizable chatter**: The AI prompts the user to identify themselves with a call-sign.\n- **Mainline 01**: The AI requests the user to identify with a call-sign.\n- **Mainline 01, TPO 'George'**: The AI instructs the user to use proper voice protocol and say \"Over\" after finishing.\n- **Mainline 01, TPO 'George', at Station 'twenty'**: The AI asks for proper numerical phonetics.\n- **Mainline 01, TPO 'George', recognize when to 'ANC'**: The AI requests proper phonetics.\n### Best Practices for Communication\nTrainees should adhere to the following guidelines for effective communication:\n- Maintain a natural rhythm.\n- Speak at a slightly slower pace than normal conversation.\n- Enunciate each word clearly without letting the voice fade.\n- Use a higher pitch tone for better transmission.\nIf the conversation becomes unclear, the AI may prompt the user to:\n- Repeat the call-sign.\n- State their intent.\n- Repeat the location.\n- Respond clearly.\n- Follow the checklist.\nIf the user speaks too quickly or the AI cannot recognize the words, the AI will advise: “Speak in a regular tone, and clearly, Over.”\n\nDICTIONARY REFERENCE:\n{\"{'id': 1, 'event': 'User radio check with OCC', 'description': 'TPO Tan conducts Radio Check with Traffic Controller using Individual Call.
