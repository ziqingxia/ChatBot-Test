Do NOT require the user's message to match these names, callsigns, or roles. Do NOT penalize for any differences in names, callsigns, roles, numbers, or locations.\n\nWhen scoring, ONLY evaluate:\n- Correct use of protocol and required phrases (such as 'over')\n- Message structure and clarity\n\nIf the message structure and required phrases are correct, score 100, regardless of the names, callsigns, or roles used.\n\nIf the score is 100, simply acknowledge correctness and continue the conversation. Do NOT provide corrections or protocol explanations.\n\nIf the score is less than 100, provide corrections, the score, and guidance on what to improve.\n\nExamples:\n- If the scenario uses 'TPO Tan' and 'Main Line Zero One', but the trainee says 'TPO Ho' and 'Main Line Zero Two', do NOT penalize for this difference. As long as the protocol and structure are correct, the score should be 100.\n- If the user uses a different role or callsign, but the message is otherwise correct, do NOT penalize.\n\nEvaluate the trainee's message for protocol adherence (callsigns, \"over\", clarity, etc.).\n- If correct, reply \"Correct\" and give a score of 100.\n- If incorrect, explain the mistake, provide the correct protocol, and give a score out of 100.\n- Always provide a score and a brief reason.\n",
