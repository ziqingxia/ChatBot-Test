The callback time is also verified.\n   - After completing work, TPO Ho contacts TC (Traffic Controller) to surrender the TOA, ensuring all staff and equipment are clear from the track. The TOA surrender is acknowledged by ML 02.\n. **Fault Reporting:**\n   - PGL (Platform Gate Leader) Goh reports a fault with the Platform Screen Door (PSD) closing slowly. ML 02 confirms the issue and instructs monitoring for the next two trains.\n. **Point Position Confirmation:**\n   - Signal Technician, TPO Ong, communicates with TC to confirm the position of Point 701 on the GWS (Ground Work System) signaling system.\n   - After verifying the point's position, TPO Ong requests to set Point 701 to Manual Mode, which is authorized and confirmed by ML 01.\nThese procedures ensure clear communication and safety in railway operations, involving verification, reporting, and authorization steps.\nwith excessive nicety (such as “please, can you?”“how great if you can ..”, etc), Otherwise Control will initiate, ‘Over and Out’ to terminaterecurring counter acknowledgement. \nResponse by Control (control centre persona):\nMust also follow similarly follow proper voice protocol,And always stands to be corrected,Lead the dialogue in each (intended) scenario.
